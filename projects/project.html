          As a member of the Product team, my responsibilities are to understand and solve ‘problems’ for the three main teams in the company: Demand, Supply, and Operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is achieved by firstly understanding their issues through need finding and data analysis. Once we have our hypotheses, we run experiments of potential solutions through MVPs. Once a solution is validated, we iterate and productize these processes by running bi-weekly agile sprints. We then assist each team in creating systems around these solutions and periodically assess their impact.

        <p>Once the new booking flow was done, the option to book a previous worker was added on top of that. The previous worker is selected at the start of the flow and only availability of the selected worker is checked. The solution was designed to have minimal development effort and integrated easily with the new booking flow.</p>
