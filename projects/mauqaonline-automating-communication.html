      <div class="col-md-6 mb24">

        <p>
          Mauqa Online is an on-demand domestic help service. Whenever a customer books the service, the company connects the customer to a blue-collar worker. The company relies on a call centre to execute all booking operations. The call centre operator would manually call each worker to convey or collect information such as schedules, reminder, arranging rides, punching booking start and end times, and much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The worker mobile app was not viable in relaying information because 25% of the workers do not have a smart phone. And 60% of the worker base is illiterate so textual channels such as messages cannot be relied on to convey and collect information.
        </p>
        <p>
          This restricted us to using voice through calls. The reliance on manually calling up workers was really costly and bound the company to a limited number of bookings per day, as there were on average 15 calls to a worker on each booking. So automating communication became a business necessity to scale, rather than to just increase productivity.
        </p>

          Hypotheses for solution

      </div>


      <div class="col-md-6 mb24">

        <p>
          I started with documenting the communication process that was followed for each booking. I then categorized it into either Outbound Communication (initiated by operators) or Inbound Communication (initiated by worker).
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>
              Outbound: Reminders about upcoming bookings, ride details, customer address, booking assignment, cash deposit reminders
            </li>
            <li>
              Inbound: Recording start and end time of a booking
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          For some outbound communication, a response was required from the worker as well, such as confirming availability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next I created a basic literacy survey for 100 workers. It was found that 20% could read Urdu on Roman format, 40% could read Urdu and 97% could read numbers. This identified that textual channels such as SMS could be used to convey one-way information, as long as the format was numerical. This also led to the conclusion that voice is still the most effective channel and it will need to be automated.

      <div class="col-md-6 mb24">
        <p>
          For voice, a 3rd-party voice campaign software by Telenor was used as a MVP. For testing if workers were able to understand and respond to 'Robocalls', I pre-recorded instructions for booking reminders. These were initiated manually by our operators and the worker's response was recorded using either 1 or 2 keypress on their phone's dial-pad. The adoption was slow at start, but with a few iterations, it rose to 90%. This validated our hypothesis that automating voice calls could be an effective channel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, to test out SMS, I started sharing worker's ride details via SMS, rather than over a call. This included the registration number of their vehicles. Even the illiterate worker was able to match the number plates using the numbers in the text. This validated the hypothesis that SMS could be used to convey familiar information as long as it follows a template.
        </p>

        <figure class="mt40 mb40">

          <img src="../assets/images/projects/infobip.png" alt="flow" width="100%">

        </figure>

        <p>

          With these 2 channels validated, I used another 3rd-party software, Infobip, with our system as their software offered more flexibility. I used their Text-to-Speech functionality to convert roman urdu text to pre-recorded audio. This saved us the hassle of recording all audio in advance and fine tune it easily. We integrated their APIs to our backend, so that worker responses could be recorded directly to our database.
        </p>

        <p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>
              For all 2-way outbound communication, I used automated voice calls to inform workers and gather their responses.
            </li>
            <li>
              For all 1-way outbound communication, I used SMS to convey static information.
            </li>
            <li>
              For inbound communication, I setup an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system on a phone number.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          I created complex decision trees called 'Flows' to cater to any failures or common use-cases for each communication. If a worker selected a wrong option or dropped the call, etc. there was always an 'if-else' condition added to each step to handle it.

            Although the plan was to roll out features one by one, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced us to launch features sooner. We reduced our agent count from 9 down to just 1. Luckily for us, the automation was able to support the agent in handling most of the workload.

          <p>
            For me, automating these multiple process was a complex undertaking as it was not just a challenge on the technological front. It required an understanding of the worker's comprehension, constraints and behaviour. One example for this would be that even though information was conveyed clearly over call, most of the workers were not familiar with the concept of pressing the keypad to record a response. The use of this feature was then added to their training later.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key takeaway from this project is that to automate or productize any process, it is crucial that the process is refined and validated. If the process does not work 20% of the time, it will compound when automated and increase your headache by 200%. It has always helped me to follow the process of Lean or Human-Centered Design:
